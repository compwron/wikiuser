The Soundstage Sessions is the tenth album released by the American
singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks. Although it is the
first live album of Nicks' solo career, it was produced to sound like a studio
album.

1. Album Information


The Soundstage Sessions was recorded in October 2007 before an intimate
audience at WTTW's Grainger Studio in Chicago, with the set list containing 18
songs. In early 2008, Nicks went to Nashville and entered the studio with
director/producer Joe Thomas. In the studio, they added "Nashville strings" and
additional vocals to the songs that were to go on the CD. Nicks wanted the CD
to sound perfect, and when asked about the project has said "I am as proud of
this as anything Ive ever done in my entire career."
