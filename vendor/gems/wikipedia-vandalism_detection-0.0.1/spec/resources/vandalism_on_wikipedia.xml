On [[Wikipedia]], '''Vandalism''' is the act of editing the project in a manner that is intentionally disruptive. Vandalism includes the addition, removal, or other modification of the text or other material in a manner that consists either of humor, nonsense, [[hoax]]es, [[spam]] or promotion of a subject, or is of an offensive or degrading nature. 

Frequent targets of vandalism include articles on hot and controversial topics and current events&lt;ref name=Newzealand/&gt;.

==Fighting vandalism==
The are various measures taken by Wikipedia to prevent or reduce the amount of vandalism. These include:
*Reverting the vandalism by restoring the article to the last version before the vandalism occurred&lt;ref name=Newzealand/&gt;
*Locking articles so only established users, or in some cases, only administrators can edit them&lt;ref name=Newzealand/&gt;
*Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely&lt;ref name=Newzealand/&gt;

==Notable acts of vandalism==
*In 2006, [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] printed a false story from which they learned the information from an act of Wikipedia vandalism. Their article's title stated that [[Halle Berry]] was set to ruin her reputation&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone_prints_story_based_on_Wikipedia_vandalism&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Professional golfer [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] sued a Miami company whose IP-based edits to the Wikipedia site included negative information about him&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomshardware.com/news/golfer-sues-wikipedia-vandalism,4377.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*Soon after the death of [[Steve Irwin]] in 2007, the [[stingray]] article was vandalized, stating that stingrays &quot;hate Australian people.&quot;&lt;ref name=Newzealand&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10432042&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">On [[Wikipedia]], '''Vandalism''' is the act of editing the project in a manner that is intentionally disruptive. Vandalism includes the addition, removal, or other modification of the text or other material in a manner that consists either of humor, nonsense, [[hoax]]es, [[spam]] or promotion of a subject, or is of an offensive or degrading nature. 

Vandalism is easy to commit on Wikipedia due to the fact that anyone can edit the site&lt;ref name=newscientist/&gt;. Founder [[Jimmy Wales]] is very much aware of the fact that the open editing policy allows the addition of false information&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4502846.stm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Most vandalism is committed on impulse&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;. Frequent targets of vandalism include articles on hot and controversial topics and current events&lt;ref name=Newzealand/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/jun/18/wikipedia.news&lt;/ref&gt;.

*Blocking and banning those who have repeatedly committed acts of vandalism from editing for a period of time or in some cases, indefinitely&lt;ref name=Newzealand/&gt;

In 2005, Wikipedia started to require those who create new articles to have a registered account in an effort to fight some vandalism. This occurred after inaccurate information was added to Wikipedia in which a journalist was accused of taking part in Kennedy's assassination&lt;ref name=newscientist&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8425-wikipedia-tightens-editorial-rules-after-complaint.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2009, Wikipedia instituted a new policy in which the posting of edits to articles on living people would be delayed until they could be reviewed for inclusion of a source to verify accuracy. This was in an effort to prevent inaccurate and potentially damaging information about living people from appearing on the site&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ebrandz.com/miscellaneous/2009/2824-wikipedia-plans-to-enforce-new-editing-policy-to-thwart-vandals-.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
