The '''Chinatown neighborhood of [[Manhattan]]''' &mdash; a [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]] &mdash; is district with a large population of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] immigrants. Manhattan's Chinatown is one of the largest Chinese communities outside of Asia. After an enormous growth spurt during the 1990s, it has been declining in recent years. Relocation of businesses and residents as a result of Sept. 11, 2001, and Manhattan's rising high rent amidst bad economic times are to blame. A committee task force was introduced by NYC officials in 2009 to address this and other concerns plaguing Chinatown.

==Location==
The traditional borders of Chinatown are:
* [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] in the North (bordering [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]])
* [[Bowery|The Bowery]] in the East (bordering the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]])
* [[Worth Street (Manhattan)|Worth Street]] in the South

===Ah Ken and early Chinese immigration===
{{Main|Ah Ken}}
Although [[Quimbo Appo]] is claimed to have arrived in the area during the 1840s, the first man credited to permanently immigrate to Chinatown was Ah Ken, a Cantonese businessman, who eventually founded a successful [[cigar store]] on [[Park Row]].<ref name="Moss">Moss, Frank.

Chronicles of a Famous Street'' (1931).<ref name="Harlow"/> 
Later immigrants would similarly find work as "cigar men" or carrying billboards and Ah Ken's particular success encouraged cigar makers William Longford, John Occoo and John Ava to also ply their trade in Chinatown eventually forming a monopoly on the cigar trade.<ref>Tchen, John Kuo Wei.

===Chinese exclusion period===
Faced with increasing discrimination and new laws which prevented participation in many occupations on the West Coast, some Chinese immigrants moved to the East Coast cities in search of employment. Early businesses in these cities included hand laundries and restaurants. Chinatown started on [[Mott Street]], Park, Pell and [[Bloody Angle|Doyers]] streets, east of the notorious [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] district. By 1870, there was a Chinese population of 200. By the time the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 was passed, the population was up to 2,000 residents. By 1900, there were 7,000 Chinese residents, but fewer than 200 Chinese women.
The early days of Chinatown were dominated by Chinese "[[tong (gang)|tongs]]" (now sometimes rendered neutrally as "associations"), which were a mixture of clan associations, landsman's associations, political alliances ([[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) vs [[Communist Party of China]]) and (more secretly) crime syndicates. The associations started to give protection from harassment due to anti-Chinese sentiment. Each of these associations was aligned with a street gang. The associations were a source of assistance to new immigrants - giving out loans, aiding in starting business, and so forth.
The associations formed a governing body named the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]]（中華公所). Though this body was meant to foster relations between the Tongs, open warfare periodically flared between the ''[[On Leong]]'' (安良) and ''[[Hip Sing]]'' (協勝) tongs.  Much of the Chinese gang warfare took place on Doyers street. [[Gang]]s like the ''[[Ghost Shadows]]'' (鬼影) and ''[[Flying Dragons (gang)|Flying Dragons]]'' (飛龍) were prevalent until the 1980s.
The only park in Chinatown, Columbus Park, was built on what was once the center of the infamous [[Five Points (Manhattan)|Five Points]] neighborhood of New York. During the 19th century, this was the most dangerous slum area of immigrant New York (as portrayed in the movie ''[[Gangs of New York]]'').

===Post-immigration reform===
{{Refimprove|section|date=October 2009}}
In the years after the United States enacted the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], allowing many more immigrants from Asia into the country, the population of Chinatown exploded. Geographically, much of the growth was to neighborhoods to the north.
In the 1990s, Chinese people began to move into some parts of the western [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], which 50 years earlier was populated by Eastern European [[Jew]]s and 20 years earlier was occupied by Hispanics. There are today only a few remnants of Jewish heritage left on the Lower East Side, such as the famous [[Katz's Deli]] and a number of synagogues and other old religious establishments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
Chinatown was adversely affected by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Being so physically close to [[Ground Zero]], tourism and business has been very slow to return to the area. Part of the reason was the [[New York City Police Department]] closure of [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]] - one of two major roads linking the Financial Center with Chinatown. A lawsuit is pending before the State Superior Court regarding this action.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
Currently, the raising prices of Manhattan real estate and rents are also affecting Chinatown and it seems that the neighborhood is shrinking to its original borders. New and poorer immigrants cannot afford their rents and a process of relocation to [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] has started, and apartments particularly in the Lower East Side and Little Italy that used to be home for new Chinese immigrants are being bought and renovated by well-to-do Americans{{Who|date=March 2009}}, including Chinese-Americans. Many of the displaced have also left for the greener pastures of larger Chinatowns like [[San Francisco]]'s, which is currently experiencing revitalized growth and prosperity after nearly two decades of decline.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

By 2009 many newer Chinese immigrants settled along East Broadway instead of the historic core west of the [[Bowery]]. In addition [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] began to eclipse [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] as the predominate Chinese dialect in New York's Chinatown during the period. Kirk Semple of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said in a 2009 article that [[Flushing, Queens]] began to rival Manhattan's Chinatown in terms of being a cultural center for Chinese-speaking New Yorkers' politics and trade.<ref name="Chinesechange">Semple, Kirk. "[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. October 21, 2009. Retrieved on October 27, 2009.</ref>

{{Citations missing|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Chinatown 01 - New York City.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A shop selling traditional herbal medicines]]
Chinese green-grocers and fishmongers are clustered around Mott Street, Mulberry Street, [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] (by Baxter Street) and all along [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]] (especially by Catherine Street).  The Chinese [[jewelry]] shop district is on Canal Street between Mott and Bowery. Due to the high savings rate among Chinese, there are many Asian and American banks in the neighborhood. Canal Street, west of Broadway (especially on the North side), is filled with Chinese street vendors selling imitation perfumes, watches, and hand-bags, which are largely purchased by tourists and non-Chinese. This section of Canal Street was previously the home of warehouse stores selling surplus/salvage electronics and hardware.
Besides the more than 200 Chinese restaurants in the area for employment, there are still some factories. The proximity of the fashion industry has kept some garment work in the local area though most of the garment industry has moved to China. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The local garment industry now concentrates on quick production in small volumes and piece-work (paid by the piece) which is generally done at the worker's home.  Much of the population growth is due to immigration. As previous generations of immigrants gain language and education skills, they tend to move to better housing and job prospects that are available in the suburbs and outer boroughs of New York.

[[Image:Nycctown.jpg|thumb|Another view of Chinatown]]
[[File:chinatown manhattan 2009.JPG|thumb|Bayard and Mott]]
Unlike most other urban Chinatowns, Manhattan's Chinatown is both a residential area as well as commercial area. Most population estimates{{Or|date=September 2009}} are in the range of 90,000 to 100,000 residents.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} It is difficult to get an exact count, as neighborhood participation in the [[U.S. Census]] is thought to be low due to language barriers, as well as large-scale illegal immigration.
Until the 1960s, the majority of the Chinese population in Chinatown emigrated from [[Guangdong]] province and [[Hong Kong]], thus they were native speakers of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], especially the [[Standard Cantonese|Canton]] and [[Taishan dialect]]s. A minority of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] was also represented. [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] was rarely spoken by residents even well into the 1980s. Most recent immigrants are from [[Mainland China]], and hence speak Mandarin, the official spoken language of [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Immigration reform in 1965 opened the door to a huge influx of Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong, and Cantonese became the dominant tongue. But since the 1990s, the vast majority of new Chinese immigrants have come from mainland China, especially Fujian Province, and tend to speak Mandarin along with their regional dialects. A significant portion are from [[Fuzhou]], [[Fujian]] province, so they are native speakers of the [[Fuzhou dialect]] of [[Min Chinese|Min]]. Most Fuzhou immigrants are illegal immigrants while most of the Cantonese immigrants are legal immigrants in Manhattan's Chinatown.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rousmaniere |first=Peter |url=http://www.workingimmigrants.com/2006/03/smuggling_of_chinese_workers_i_1.html |title=Smuggling of Chinese workers into the United States |publisher=workingimmigrants.com |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> With the coming of illegal Fuzhou immigrants during the 1990s, there is now a Fuzhou Community in the eastern portion of Manhattan's Chinatown which started on the East Broadway portion and later emerged north onto the Eldridge Street portion of Manhattan's Chinatown. Although the Fuzhou community and its population, which is now hardly growing have emerged within Manhattan's Chinatown, the Cantonese population still remains large and continues to retain the large Cantonese community identity where the Cantonese residents still have a place of gathering that was established decades ago in the western portion/main section of Manhattan's Chinatown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nychinatown.org/ebway.html |title=A journey through China town |publisher=Nychinatown.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref> 

Now the Fuzhou influx has shifted into Brooklyn's Chinatown in the [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] section of Brooklyn.  Since Brooklyn's Chinatown is smaller than Manhattan's Chinatown, and given its rapidly increasing Fuzhou population, Brooklyn's Chinatown is quickly becoming the new ''Little Fuzhou'' in NYC and is on the way of surpassing the ''Little Fuzhou'' already established within Manhattan's Chinatown as the largest Fuzhou population/community in NYC. Even though Brooklyn's Chinatown has fewer Cantonese people than Manhattan's Chinatown, there are still many Cantonese shops between 50th-62nd streets on 8th Avenue. Traditionally, Fuzhou immigrant community/population would always be mixed with a large Cantonese population and other Chinese populations in Chinese communities, however, as Brooklyn's Chinatown is becoming the New Little Fuzhou and with the continuing rapid decline in the Cantonese population in Brooklyn's Chinatown, it is on its way to become the first Fuzhou population/community to not be traditionally surrounded/neighbored and/or mixed with large Cantonese populations and/or other Chinese populations like currently in Manhattan's Chinatown and Flushing's Chinatown.<ref name="worldjournal.com">[http://www.worldjournal.com/english/wj-eng_news.php?nt_seq_id=1341407&sc_seq_id=1930 ]{{dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>

Although Mandarin is spoken as a native language among only ten percent of Chinese speakers in NYC's Chinatown, it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them and is on its way to replace Cantonese as their [[lingua franca]].<ref name="Garcia">{{cite book | last = García | first = Ofelia | coauthors = Fishman, Joshua A. | title = The Multilingual Apple: Languages in New York City | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2002 | isbn = 311017281X}}</ref>  Although Min Chinese is spoken natively by a third of the Chinese population in the city, it is not used as a lingua franca because speakers of other dialect groups do not learn Min.<ref name="Garcia"/>

==Buildings==
{{Citations missing|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Confucious Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Confucius Plaza'' 44-story [[subsidized housing|subsidized]] [[housing cooperative]], above typical Chinatown housing stock]]
===Housing===
The housing stock of Chinatown is still mostly composed of cramped [[tenement]] buildings, some of which are over 100 years old. It is still common in such buildings to have bathrooms in the hallways, to be shared among multiple apartments.
A federally [[subsidized housing]] project, named [[Confucius Plaza]], was completed on the corner of [[Bowery (Manhattan)|Bowery]] and Division streets in 1976. This 44-story residential [[tower block]] gave much needed new housing stock to thousands of residents. The building also housed a new public grade school, [http://schools.nyc.gov/OurSchools/Region9/M124/default.htm?searchType=school P.S. 124] (or Yung Wing Elementary). Since new housing is normally non-existent in Chinatown, many apartments in the building were acquired by wealthy individuals through under-the-table dealings, even though the building was built as [[affordable housing]].
===Landmarks===
For much of Chinatown's history, there were few unique architectural features to announce to visitors that they had arrived in the neighborhood (other than the language of the shop signs). In 1962, at [[Chatham Square, Manhattan|Chatham Square]] the Lt. Benjamin Ralph Kimlau Memorial archway was erected in memorial of the Chinese-Americans who died in [[World War II]]. This memorial, which bears calligraphy by the great [[Yu Youren]] 于右任 (1879&mdash;1964), is mostly ignored by the residents due to its poor location on a busy car thoroughfare with little pedestrian traffic. A statue of [[Lin Zexu]], also known as Commissioner Lin, a Fuzhou-based Chinese official who opposed the opium trade, is also located at the square; it faces uptown along East Broadway, now home to the bustling Fuzhou neighborhood and known locally as Fuzhou Street (Fúzhóu jiē 福州街). In the 1970s, [[New York Telephone]], then the local phone company started capping the street phone
booths with [[pagoda]]-like decorations. In 1976, the statue of [[Confucius]] in front of ''Confucius Plaza'' became a common meeting place. In the 1980s, banks which opened new branches and others which were renovating started to use Chinese traditional styles for their building facades. The [[Church of the Transfiguration (Mott Street, New York, New York)|Church of the Transfiguration]], a national historic site built in 1815, stands off Mott Street.

==Satellite Chinatowns==
{{Citations missing|date=November 2008}}
{{Main|Flushing, Queens|Sunset Park, Brooklyn}}
Other New York City area Chinese communities have been settled over the years, including that of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in [[Queens]].  Another community is located in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] in [[Brooklyn]], particularly along 8th Avenue from 40th to 65th Streets.  New York's newest Chinatown has recently sprung up on Avenue U in the [[Homecrest, Brooklyn|Homecrest]] section of Brooklyn. Outside of New York City proper, a growing suburban Chinatown is developing in [[Edison, New Jersey]], which lies {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the southwest.
While the composition of these satellite Chinatowns is as varied as the original, the political turmoils in the Manhattan Chinatown ([[Tong (organization)|Tongs]] vs. [[Republic of China]] loyalists vs. [[People's Republic of China]] loyalists vs. Americanized) has led to some factionalization in the other satellites.  The [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] Chinatown, for example, was spearheaded by many Chinese fleeing the Communist retaking of [[Hong Kong]] in 1997 as well as Taiwanese who used their considerable capital to buy out land from the former  residents.  The [[Brooklyn]] Chinatown located in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] however, is mostly immigrant and populated by both [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Fujian|Fukienese]] newcomers to America, however the [[Fujian|Fukienese]] is on its way of turning the Chinese Community into the new, more established, and bigger Fuzhou community than the one in the eastern portion of Manhattan's Chinatown.<ref name="worldjournal.com"/>  More culturally
assimilated Chinese have moved outside these neighborhoods into more white or Hispanic neighborhoods in the city while others move to the suburbs outright.
