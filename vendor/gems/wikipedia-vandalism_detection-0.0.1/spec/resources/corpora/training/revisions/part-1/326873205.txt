'''''The Soundstage Sessions''''' is the tenth album released by the American singer-songwriter and [[Fleetwood Mac]] vocalist [[Stevie Nicks]]. Although it is the first live album of Nicks' solo career, it was produced to sound like a studio album.


==Album Information==
''The Soundstage Sessions'' was recorded in October 2007 before an intimate audience at [[WTTW]]'s Grainger Studio in [[Chicago]], with the [[set list]] containing 18 songs. In early 2008, Nicks went to [[Nashville]] and entered the studio with director/producer [[Joe Thomas (producer/director)|Joe Thomas]]. In the studio, they added "Nashville strings" and additional vocals to the songs that were to go on the CD. Nicks wanted the CD to sound perfect, and when asked about the project has said "I am as proud of this as anything I’ve ever done in my entire career."  <ref>http://popculturezoo.com/archives/2255</ref>
